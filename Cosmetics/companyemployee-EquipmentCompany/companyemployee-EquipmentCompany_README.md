# Equipment Company 

    As a contractor for the Company, it wouldn't hurt to invest in some of your own equipment before punching in. 

    Fortunately, the market is ripe with passed down or unused kit - many of it retired or taken from previous crews of unknown fates.

    Purchasing them was simple enough. Hopefully, they can find new service in your own crew's hands...

## Description

I tried making MoreCompany cosmetics that fit thematically within the game. 

There's a lot of joke ones available, which are fun, but it was hard to find any that specifically fit the theme of the base game. So I tried making this!

Enjoy!

## Misc

All cosmetics in this mod were modeled by me! All the lore below is basically flavor text and not official.

All of these are cosmetics; none of them provide any additional advantages.

Inspiration taken from various types of construction & hiking gear.
